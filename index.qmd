## What {-}

This course will introduce biologists and bioinformaticians to the field of 
single-cell RNA sequencing. 
We will cover a range of software and analysis workflows that extend 
over the spectrum from the best practices in the filtering scRNA-seq data  
to the downstream analysis of cell clusters and temporal ordering. 
This course will help the attendees gain accurate insights in pre-processing, 
analysis and interpretation of scRNA-seq data.

We will start by introducing general concepts about single-cell RNA-sequencing. 
From there, we will then continue to describe the main analysis steps to go 
from raw sequencing data to processed and usable data. We will present 
classical analysis workflows, their output and the possible paths to 
investigate downstream of this.  

Throughout the workshop, `bash` tools and `R/Bioconductor` packages will 
be used to analyse datasets and learn new approaches. 

## When {-}

From November 4 to November 8, 2025.

## Where {-}

This course will be held online.

## How {-}

The course is structured in modules over five days. 
Each day will include formal lectures covering the key concepts required to 
understand scRNA-seq analysis. 
The remainder of each day will consist in practical hands-on sessions focusing 
on analysis of scRNA-seq data. 
These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with 
the instructor to demonstrate a skill, as well as applying these skills on 
your own to complete individual exercises.  
During and after each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed 
as a group.

## Who {-}

The course will be mostly beneficial to those who have, or will shortly have, 
scRNA-seq data ready to analyse.  

The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn 
more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists 
who want to learn about scRNA-seq methods.  

Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol 
or biological system.

The requirements for this course are: 

1. Working knowledge of Unix / command line interface (managing files, running programs, reading manuals!). Basic bash commands (`cd`, `ls`, `...`) and CLI usage will _not_ be covered in this course. We advice attendees to not register if they lack fundamental experience in CLI.
2. Programming experience in `R` (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). `Bioconductor` experience is a plus. 
3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data)

## Why {-}

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand the pros/cons of different single-cell RNA-seq methods
- Process and QC of scRNA-seq data
- Normalize scRNA-seq data
- Correct for batch effects
- Visualise the data and applying dimensionality reduction
- Perform cell clustering and annotation 
- Perform differential gene expression analysis
- Infer cell trajectory and pseudotime, and perform temporal differential expression 

Throughout the course, we will also have a focus on reproducible research, documented content and interactive reports.
